Certainly! Let's break down the project into finer steps:

Step 1: Set Up the Environment
Install necessary libraries: numpy, opencv-python, pytesseract.
Make sure Tesseract OCR is installed on your system.

Step 2: Capture Video and Detect Sudoku Grid
Read the live camera feed using OpenCV.
Apply image processing to detect the Sudoku grid.

Step 3: Determine Puzzle Size and Extract Characters
Identify whether it's a 9x9 or 16x16 Sudoku puzzle.
Divide the grid into cells and extract characters from each cell.

Step 4: Save Extracted Data to Text File
Save the extracted Sudoku puzzle matrix to a text file (sudoku_matrix.txt).

Step 5: Solve the Sudoku Puzzle
Implement a Sudoku solver function to solve the puzzle.

Step 6: Save Solved Puzzle to Text File
Save the solved Sudoku puzzle matrix to a text file (sudoku_matrix_solved.txt).

Step 7: Compare Input and Output Files
Read both input and output text files.
Identify positions where the input has '0' and find corresponding solved values.

Step 8: Project Solved Values onto Live Feed
Use the inverse homogenous matrix to overlay the solved values onto the live video feed.
Display the live feed with the projected solved values.

Step 9: Final Testing and Adjustment
Run the complete code and test on different Sudoku puzzles.
Adjust parameters if needed.
This sequence of steps should cover the entire process, from capturing the video feed to solving the Sudoku puzzle and projecting the solution onto the live feed. Let me know if you have any specific questions or if you'd like more details on any particular step!
