in the following task, you cannot drop anything in above you identified. I men thse things you cannot drop

Function Definitions:

is_approx_rectangular: Checks if a contour is approximately rectangular.
is_contour_valid: Checks if a contour is not too long or too short.
is_contour_area_valid: Checks if a contour has a reasonable area.
approximate_remaining_cells: Approximates the remaining cells once a certain percentage is detected.
Initialization:

Video capture is set up from the webcam (cv2.VideoCapture(0)).
Variables to store contours over multiple frames (all_cell_contours) and the warped image (warped) are initialized.
Contour Detection:

After waiting for 3 seconds, the code enters a loop where each frame from the webcam is processed.
The frame is converted to grayscale, blurred, and edges are detected using the Canny edge detector.
Contours are found in the edged image, and the largest contour (presumed Sudoku puzzle) is identified and approximated to a polygon.
If the Sudoku puzzle is detected (assuming 4 corners), a corrected projective transformation is applied to obtain a warped image.
The warped image is further processed by rotating, flipping, converting to grayscale, applying GaussianBlur, and using the Canny edge detector.
Contours in the flattened Sudoku grid image are found and filtered to include only rectangular contours.
Contour Visualization:

Contours are drawn on the original frame and the warped image to visualize the Sudoku puzzle and detected cells.
The detected cell contours are stored in the all_cell_contours list.
A new window (Detected Cell Contours) is created to show the detected cell contours on the warped image.
Remaining Cell Approximation:

A function (approximate_remaining_cells) is used to approximate the remaining cells in the Sudoku puzzle once a certain percentage is detected.
Display:

The resulting frame with detected contours (Sudoku Recognition), the Sudoku Wrapped Image (Warped Image), and the detected cell contours (Detected Cell Contours) are displayed.
The loop continues until the 'q' key is pressed.
Release Resources:

The webcam is released, and all OpenCV windows are closed.





Instead you can add more functions and code to this code and do the following work. Followinf work related code parts can be slightly changed as needed and it is undertandable..


The work is

I want to add some ideas to make this more faster.

So ralted to ('Detected Cell Contours', contours_image) realted work we do right now, these points can be considered.




Only one contour can be there in a perticuler small area to represent a grid. So once an area relted contour is detected and it is recored, you can skip this area and process only the other regions. SO when we detect more and more contours, the region reduces. les procesing required.



Also this is definitly a grid, so once you detect a cell contour, you can expect approximatly same sized contours in all the other regions as well. But it can be slightly changed. SO this can be used as a heuristic to find the rest.




Also once a contour rectangle is detected, you can assume such contours in both horizontaly inlined to it and vertivcalli inlined to it. assuming that you can search for contours in those diretions and if anything is slighly like a contour in those directions, you can consider it as a cell and you are safe to add it. So with this point, we approximatly get to contours that are not detected by the vision system related cv2 processing code.


Also after detectling like 15% of the area of the puzzle, you can assume the rest of the contours since you know this is a grid and you have the idea of a single contour bub 15% completion. So comoplete it rapidly after this point


So basically my targets are,

1 ) precisly identify whetherthe puzzle is 16x 16 or 9x9, for that you can cinsider the green puzzle size related contour and small conntours and you can approximate the size comparison and get the idea of 9x9 or 16x16. 

2 ) apart of that you should detect the edges of the puzzle. basically by detecting edges we can consider each cells and extract characters from them no. But in my approch, we cinsider cells as contours, so no need to consider edges related calcaulations to find those cell spaces with characters. Instead I capture a set of contures  around 15%. And on the way to 15%, I approximate whether the puzzle is 16x16 or 9x9. 

SO with both thse data, you can decide how this puzzle look. Since it is a 2D grid, you can imput the rest of the contoures after 15% point using a code. So after 15%, the 100% contouurs are generated instantly with this code I propose.


The case is you have to conside the cell shape by considering contour shape, gap between two cells by considering adjustion contore gap in both vertically and horizontally sepetatly.




So when you consider all these points, The code will be longer. But I think the conde will be time wise efficient.

So do this.


Please implement all those as custom python codes(functions) and do it as I told.

So once after 15% of the puzzle cells related contours are detected, you should instantly calculate and approximate the rest without considering the video feed in.
